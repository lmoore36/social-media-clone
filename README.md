# social-media-clone

I built this using JavaScript and CSS, powered by Next.js and React. I used Supabase for data storage. This project creates a secure platform where users can sign up, log in, and access their personalized feed. The feed displays posts from accounts they follow, with each post showing the author's name, text, and like count. Users can also view and edit their profile information, including their bio. Navigation between pages is easy with a built-in navigation bar.
